# An Emergency Call Line


 ## Introduction


Normally, each of the emergency call lines is accessed from different call lines. This situation becomes quite complicated for the person who witnessed the emergency status moment. We aim to eliminate this problem with the emergency managment system.A new call line will be developed to simplify the important call lines which are being used in daily life frequently such as ambulance,police and fire department and to collect all of those call lines into the single line

## Problem

Thanks to the emergency system managment, the different lines used in emergencies will be reduced to a single line, thus avoiding confusion.The area in which the person entering the system will report will be determined. Then, personal information will be requested and the notices will be recorded.There will be features such as notification update, delete of a notification, and add a different notification

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution of this problem is collect the all important call lines into the single line.In this way, provide more efficient and fast service to the people.This single line has some functions which provide to reach fastly and from single one point to the service.

SELECT : Selection function allows people to choose the department which they want to call on a single call line.

ADD :  This function allows people to create a new denunciation.

UPDATE : this updating function allows people to update existing denunciation informations such as address or detail.

DELETE : deletion function allows people to delete denunciation by entering a explanation

TRANSLATE : this translation function for international citizens allows to see the menu in english.
